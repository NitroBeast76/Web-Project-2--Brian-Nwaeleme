        <h4><b><u>Events that led up to it</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <!-- List of events leading to the treaty -->
            <li>Before Canada became a country, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) had a massive area called Rupert's Land, where they traded furs with Indigenous people. In 1868, after Canada was formed, the HBC sold this area to the British government to transfer into Canada without consulting the resident Indigenous people about the sale. This led to the Metis, led by Louis Riel, resisting and forming their own government. After this (Red River Resistance), Canada guaranteed the Metis land for them and their descendants only, excluding other Indigenous groups like the Anishinaabe.</li><br>
            <li>Archibald was focused on bringing new people on to the land around Lake Winnipeg and getting farms. In 1871, a group of Indigenous Leaders in the land, complained, saying they didn't get anything for their land. The government appointed Wemyss Simpson as an Indian commissioner to discuss the treaty. Simpson was to secure land for Canada as cheaply possible. It was then scheduled for July 25 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, to avoid delays and costs by discussing two different treaties, Treaties 1 and 2.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#2</a></sub><br>

        <h3><b><u>The Treaty</u></b></h3>
        <h4><b><u>The Negotiations</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <!-- List of negotiation details -->
            <li>The negotiations for the Treaty started on July 27, 1871 after around 1,000 Indigenous people, including men, women and children, had set up camp near Fort Garry. With James McKay, a Metis member of Manitoba's Executive Council as interpreter, the negotiations began. The negotiations were published in the paper. Lieutenant Governor Archibald assured the people that the Queen wanted to treat them fairly, explaining that the Queen wants them to start farming but not too drastic. He also brought the idea of reserves, saying it will allow them to maintain their traditional way of life until the land was needed back. </li><br>
            <li>However, the Indigenous people believed that the demands set were to high, including the massive amount of reserves to be set aside. Archibald suggested 160 acres per family, far less than the reserves the Indigenous wanted. He also assured them that they would continue to use the land for hunting, trapping and fishing, but also implied that the settlers will come whether they liked it or not, urging them to come to a decision now. Tempers flared, and some negotiators like  Ay-ee-ta-pe-pe-tung, threatened to leave, angry at the unfairness and vague promises.</li><br>
            <li>August 2, the negotiations had reached its limit. The Indigenous negotiators were still unsure about how the Queen will help them start farming, as a lot did not know how to farm. Archibald promised that each reserve will have a school and teacher, while intending farmers will be given farming equipment. After some more discussions, the Treaty was signed on August 3, 1871. The process showed the misunderstandings between the government and the Indigenous, showing how hard it was to agree as they fought for long.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#3</a></sub><br>

        <ul>
            <!-- List of agreements -->
            <li>Treaty 1 was signed by government agents, including Lieutenant-Governor Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, Major A.G Irvine, and eight witnesses. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree signatories included leaders such as Red Eagle(Henry Prince) and Bird Forever (William Pennefather). The Treaty was approved by the Governor-General in Council on September 12, 1871. </li><br>
            <li>In the treaty, each band was promised a reserve providing 160 acres for every family of 5, or a proportional amount for smaller or larger families. Each person received a one time payment of $3 and families received $15 every year. The government also  agreed to maintain schools on each reserve and prohibit sale of liquor there. In exchange, the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree agreed to "cede, release, surrender, and yield up" a massive portion of their land, form Red River Valley, parts of Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg, to areas around the Assiniboine River. </li><sub><a href="sources.html">#4</a></sub><br>

        <h4><b><u>Outside Promises</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The written treaties did not contain any promises on the provision of farming tools, clothing, or animals, which were discussed during the negotiations. These broken promises are called "Outside Promises". Even though Chief Henry Prince and others refused to sign the treaty, Simpson agreed to put these promises in writing. By 1872, Indigenous people complained that they were cheated and the promises were not kept. Archibald blamed Simpson and the lack of a resident Indian commissioner. In 1873, Joseph Provencer was given the role. The government did not act until April 30, 1875, when they passed an order saying that those promises were now part of the treaty. These included provision of animals, tools, and raising the yearly payments to $5 from $3.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#5</a></sub><br>

                        <br><strong>COPY OF A REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF THE HONOURABLE THE PRIVY COUNCIL, APPROVED BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL ON THE 30TH APRIL, 1875</strong><br>
                        Dans un mémoire de l'honorable ministre de l'Intérieur en date du 27 avril 1875 signalant la très grande insatisfaction des Indiens à l'égard des «promesses ultérieures» aux traités nos 1 et 2 conclus avec les Indiens du Manitoba et des Territoires du Nord-Ouest les 3 et 21 août 1871 respectivement, et faisant les recommandations suivantes:<br>
                        On a memorandum dated 27th April, 1875, from the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, bringing under consideration the very unsatisfactory state of affairs arising out of the so-called "outside promises" in connection with the Indian Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, Manitoba and North-west Territories, concluded, the former on the 3rd August, 1871, and the latter on 21st of the same month, and recommending for the reasons stated:<br>
                        1st. That the written memorandum attached to Treaty No. 1 be considered as part of that Treaty and of Treaty No. 2, and that the Indian Commissioner be instructed to carry out the promises therein contained, in so far as they have not yet been carried out, and that the Commissioner be advised to inform the Indians that he has been authorized so to do.<br>
                        2nd. That the Indian Commissioner be instructed to inform the Indians, parties to Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, that, while the Government cannot admit their claim to anything which is not set forth in the treaty, and in the memorandum attached thereto, which treaty is binding alike upon the Government and upon the Indians, yet, as there seems to have been some misunderstanding between the Indian Commissioner and the Indians in the matter of Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, the Government, out of good feeling to the Indians and as a matter of benevolence, is willing to raise the annual payment to each Indian under Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, from $3 to $5 per annum, and make payment over and above such sum of $5, of $20 each and every year to each Chief, and a suit of clothing every three years to each Chief and each Headman, allowing two Headmen to each band, on the express understanding, however, that each Chief or other Indian who shall receive such increased annuity or annual payment shall be held to abandon all claim whatever against the Government in connection with the so-called "outside promises," other than those contained in the memorandum attached to the treaty.<br>
                        The Committee submit the foregoing recommendation for Your Excellency's approval:<br>
                        <strong>W.A. HIMSWORTH, Clerk Privy Council.</strong><br>

        <h4><b><u>Modern Interpretations</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The treaties did not include promises on hunting and fishing rights, though there were verbally promised. Later, the government restricted access to these resources, breaking the promises. The Supreme Court of Canada has said the written text of the treaties doesn't fully show the true context, and the historical meaning should be considered. Indigenous peoples likely didn't understand the term "surrender" the same way the Europeans did, and their views on land and law were conflicting. These problems led to the constant debate on it to this day.</li><br>
            <li>Terms such as cede(cession - giving up control of land), adhesion (the Indigenous joining a treaty they weren't initially in), land title (Indigenous rights to their land due to their long use and occupancy) and annuity(yearly payments given to them per the treaties) were used commonly in the treaties.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#6</a></sub><br>

        <h4><b><u>Modern Implications of Treaty 1</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Naawi-Oodena - The construction of the largest urban reserve made, showing that the treaty still holds strong and therefore it is still used to create more reserves in the area. This particular reserve is focused on engaging in active economic actions. </li><br>
        <li>"Urban reserves, whether in accordance with a Treaty Land Entitlement agreement or not, can only be created through Canada's Additions to Reserve Policy. This policy identifies circumstances under which land may be granted reserve status and sets out steps to be followed by the Government of Canada in assessing a First Nation's proposal for reserve lands. Proposals to set land apart as reserve must include a number of requirements, including the resolution of municipal concerns, before the process can proceed further."</li><br>
        <li>The statement above means that in order to make a reserve, you need to follow a "treaty agreement" (treaty one and other corresponding treaties.) to amke it officail and recognised for indigenous people, put does not restict economic endeavors.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#7</a></sub><br>
