        <h3><b><u>Pre-Treaty - Needs for the Treaty 1</u></b></h3>
        <h4><b><u>Events that led up to it</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Before Canada became a country, the Hudson's bay Company (HBC) had a massive area called Rupert's Land, where they traded furs witth Indigenous people. In 1868, after Canada was formed, the HBC sold this area to the British government to transfer into Canada without consulting the resident Indigenous people about the sale. This led to the Metis, led by Louis Riel, resisting and forming their own government. After this (Red River Resistance), Canada guaranteed the Metis land for them and their descendants only, excluding other Indigenous groups like the Anishinaabe.</li><br>
            <li>Archibald was focused on bringing new people on to the land around Lake Winnipeg and getting farms. In 1871, a group of Indigenous Leaders in the land, complained, saying they didnt get anything for their land. The government appointed Wemyss Simpson as an Indian commissioner to discuss the treaty. Simpson was to secure land for Canada as cheaply possible. It was then scheduled for July 25 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, to avoid delayds and costs by discussing two different treaties, Treaties 1 and 2.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#2</a></sub><br>
        </ul>
        <h4><b><u>The Negotiations</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The negotiations for the Treaty started on July 27, 1871 after around 1,000 Indigenous people, including men, women and children, had set up camp near Fort Garry. With James McKay, a Metis member of Manitoba's Executive Council as interpreter, the negotiations began. The negotiations were published in the paper. Lieutenant Governor Archibald assured the people that the Queen wanted to treat them fairly, explaining that the Queen wants them to start farming but not too drastic. He also brought the idea of reserves, saying it will allow them to maintain their traditional way of life until the land was needed back. </li><br>
            <li>However, the Indigenous people believed that the demands set were to high, including the massive amount of reserves to be set aside. Archibald suggested 160 acres per family, far less than the reserves the Indigenous wanted. He also assured them that they would continue to use the land for hunting, trapping and fishing, but laso implied that the settlers will come whether they liked it or not, urging them to come to a decision now. Tempers flared, and some negotiators like  Ay-ee-ta-pe-pe-tung, threatened to leave, angry at the unfairness and vague promises.</li><br>
            <li>August 2, the negotiations had reached its limit. The Indigenous negtiators were still unsure about how the Queen will help them start farming, as a lot did not know how to farm. Archibald promised that each reserve will have a school and teacher, while intending farmers will be given farming equipment. After some more discussions, the Treaty was signed on August 3, 1871. The process showed the misunderstandings between the government and the Indigenous, showing how hard it was to agree as they fought for long.</li><sub><a href="sources.html">#3</a></sub><br>
        </ul>
        <h4><b><u>The Agreements</u></b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Treaty 1 was signed by goverment agents, including Lieutenant-Governor Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, Major A.G Irvine, and eight witnesses. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree signatories included leaders such as Red Eagle(Henry Prince) and Bird Forever (William Pennefather). The Treaty was approved by teh Governor-General in Council on September 12, 1871. </li><br>
            <li>In the treaty, each band was promised a reserve providing 160 acres for every family of 5, or a proportional amount for smaller or larger families. Each person receioved a one time payment of $3 and families received $15 every year. The government also  agreed to maintain schools on each reserve and prohibit sale of liqour there. In exchange, the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree agreed to "cede, release, surrender, and yield up" a massive portion of their land, form Red River Valley, parts of Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg, to areas around the Assiniboine River. </li><sub><a href="sources.html">#4</a></sub><br>
