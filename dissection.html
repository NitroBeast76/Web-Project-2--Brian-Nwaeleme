        <ul>
            <li>Before Canada became a country, the Hudson's bay Company (HBC) had a massive area called Rupert's Land, where they traded furs with Indigenous people. In 1868, after Canada was formed, the HBC sold this area to the British government to transfer into Canada without consulting the resident Indigenous people about the sale. This led to the Metis, led by Louis Riel, resisting and forming their own government. After this (Red River Resistance), Canada guaranteed the Metis land for them and their descendants only, excluding other Indigenous groups like the Anishinaabe.</li><br>
            <li>Archibald was focused on bringing new people on to the land around Lake Winnipeg and getting farms. In 1871, a group of Indigenous Leaders in the land, complained, saying they didn't get anything for their land. The government appointed Wemyss Simpson as an Indian commissioner to discuss the treaty. Simpson was to secure land for Canada as cheaply possible. It was then scheduled for July 25 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, to avoid delays and costs by discussing two different treaties, Treaties 1 and 2.</li><!--Source for this info--><sub><a href="sources.html">#2</a></sub><br>

        <h3><b><u>The Treaty</u></b></h3>
        <h4><b><u>The Negotiations</u></b></h4>
        <!--Content for the negotiations section under the Treaty-->
        <ul>
            <li>The negotiations for the Treaty started on July 27, 1871 after around 1,000 Indigenous people, including men, women and children, had set up camp near Fort Garry. With James McKay, a Metis member of Manitoba's Executive Council as interpreter, the negotiations began. The negotiations were published in the paper. Lieutenant Governor Archibald assured the people that the Queen wanted to treat them fairly, explaining that the Queen wants them to start farming but not too drastic. He also brought the idea of reserves, saying it will allow them to maintain their traditional way of life until the land was needed back. </li><br>
            <li>However, the Indigenous people believed that the demands set were to high, including the massive amount of reserves to be set aside. Archibald suggested 160 acres per family, far less than the reserves the Indigenous wanted. He also assured them that they would continue to use the land for hunting, trapping and fishing, but also implied that the settlers will come whether they liked it or not, urging them to come to a decision now. Tempers flared, and some negotiators like  Ay-ee-ta-pe-pe-tung, threatened to leave, angry at the unfairness and vague promises.</li><br>
            <li>August 2, the negotiations had reached its limit. The Indigenous negotiators were still unsure about how the Queen will help them start farming, as a lot did not know how to farm. Archibald promised that each reserve will have a school and teacher, while intending farmers will be given farming equipment. After some more discussions, the Treaty was signed on August 3, 1871. The process showed the misunderstandings between the government and the Indigenous, showing how hard it was to agree as they fought for long.</li><!--Source for this info--><sub><a href="sources.html">#3</a></sub><br>

            <li>Treaty 1 was signed by goverment agents, including Lieutenant-Governor Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, Major A.G Irvine, and eight witnesses. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree signatories included leaders such as Red Eagle(Henry Prince) and Bird Forever (William Pennefather). The Treaty was approved by the Governor-General in Council on September 12, 1871. </li><br>
            <li>In the treaty, each band was promised a reserve providing 160 acres for every family of 5, or a proportional amount for smaller or larger families. Each person received a one time payment of $3 and families received $15 every year. The government also  agreed to maintain schools on each reserve and prohibit sale of liquor there. In exchange, the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree agreed to "cede, release, surrender, and yield up" a massive portion of their land, form Red River Valley, parts of Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg, to areas around the Assiniboine River. </li><sub><a href="sources.html">#4</a></sub><br>

                        Treaty 1<br>
                        ARTICLES OF A TREATY made and concluded this third day of August in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, between Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by Her Commissioner, Wemyss M. Simpson, Esquire, of the one part, and the Chippewa and Swampy Cree Tribes of Indians, inhabitants of the country within the limits hereinafter defined and described, by their Chiefs chosen and named as hereinafter mentioned, of the other part. <br><br>
                        Whereas all the Indians inhabiting the said country have, pursuant to an appointment made by the said Commissioner, been convened at a meeting at the Stone Fort, otherwise called Lower Fort Garry, to deliberate upon certain matters of interest to Her Most Gracious Majesty, of the one part, and to the said Indians of the other; and whereas the said Indians have been notified and informed by Her Majesty's said Commissioner that it is the desire of Her Majesty to open up to settlement and immigration a tract of country bounded and described as hereinafter mentioned, and to obtain the consent thereto of her Indian subjects inhabiting the said tract, and to make a treaty and arrangements with them so that there may be peace and good will between them and Her Majesty, and that they may know and be assured of what allowance they are to count upon and receive year by year from Her Majesty's bounty and benevolence. <br><br>
                        And whereas the Indians of the said tract, duly convened in council as aforesaid, and being requested by Her Majesty's said Commissioner to name certain Chiefs and Headmen who should be authorized on their behalf to conduct such negotiations and sign any treaty to be founded thereon, and to become responsible to Her Majesty for the faithful performance by their respective bands of such obligations as should be assumed by them, the said Indians have thereupon named the following persons for that purpose, that is to say: Mis-koo-kenew or Red Eagle (Henry Prince), Ka-ke-ka-penais, or Bird for ever, Na-sha-ke-penais, or Flying down bird, Na-na-wa-nanaw, or Centre of Bird's Tail, Ke-we-tayash, or Flying round, Wa-ko-wush, or Whip-poor-will, Oo-za-we-kwun, or Yellow Quill,—and thereupon in open council the different bands have presented their respective Chiefs to His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Manitoba and of the North-West Territory being present at such council, and to the said Commissioner, as the Chiefs and Headmen for the purposes aforesaid of the respective bands of Indians inhabiting the said district hereinafter described; and whereas the said Lieutenant Governor and the said Commissioner then and there received and acknowledged the persons so presented as Chiefs and Headmen for the purpose aforesaid; and whereas the said Commissioner has proceeded to negotiate a treaty with the said Indians, and the same has finally been agreed upon and concluded as follows, that is to say: <br><br>
                        The Chippewa and Swampy Cree Tribes of Indians and all other the Indians inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to Her Majesty the Queen and successors forever all the lands included within the following limits, that is to say: Beginning at the international boundary line near its junction with the Lake of the Woods, at a point due north from the centre of Roseau Lake; thence to run due north to the centre of Roseau Lake; thence northward to the centre of White Mouth Lake, otherwise called White Mud Lake; thence by the middle of the lake and the middle of the river issuing therefrom to the mouth thereof in Winnipeg River; thence by the Winnipeg River to its mouth; thence westwardly, including all the islands near the south end of the lake, across the lake to the mouth of Drunken River; thence westwardly to a point on Lake Manitoba half way between Oak Point and the mouth of Swan Creek; thence across Lake Manitoba in a line due west to its western shore; thence in a straight line to the crossing of the rapids on the Assiniboine; thence due south to the international boundary line; and thence eastwardly by the said line to the place of beginning. To have and to hold the same to Her said Majesty the Queen and Her successors for ever; and Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay aside and reserve for the sole and exclusive use of the Indians the following tracts of land, that is to say: <br><br>
                        For the use of the Indians belonging to the band of which Henry Prince, otherwise called Mis-koo-ke-new, is the Chief, so much of land on both sides of the Red River, beginning at the south line of St. Peter's Parish, as will furnish one hundred and sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families; and for the use of the Indians of whom Na-sha-ke-penais, Na-na-wa-nanaw, Ke-we-tayash and Wa-ko-wush are the Chiefs, so much land on the Roseau River as will furnish one hundred and sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families, beginning from the mouth of the river; and for the use of the Indians of which Ka-ke-ka-penais is the Chief, so much land on the Winnipeg River above Fort Alexander as will furnish one hundred and sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families, beginning at a distance of a mile or thereabout above the Fort; and for the use of the Indians of whom Oo-za-we-kwun is Chief, so much land on the south and east side of the Assiniboine, about twenty miles above the Portage, as will furnish one hundred and sixty acres for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families, reserving also a further tract enclosing said reserve to comprise an equivalent to twenty-five square miles of equal breadth, to be laid out round the reserve, it being understood, however, that if, at the date of the execution of this treaty, there are any settlers within the bounds of any lands reserved by any band, Her Majesty reserves the right to deal with such settlers as She shall deem just, so as not to diminish the extent of land allotted to the Indians. <br><br>
                        And with a view to show the satisfaction of Her Majesty with the behaviour and good conduct of Her Indian parties to this treaty, She hereby, through Her Commissioner, makes them a present of three dollars for each Indian man, woman and child belonging to the bands here represented. <br><br>
                        And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain a school on each reserve hereby made whenever the Indians of the reserve should desire it. <br><br>
                        Within the boundary of Indian reserves, until otherwise enacted by the proper legislative authority, no intoxicating liquor shall be allowed to be introduced or sold, and all laws now in force or hereafter to be enacted to preserve Her Majesty's Indian subjects inhabiting the reserves or living elsewhere from the evil influence of the use of intoxicating liquors shall be strictly enforced. <br><br>
                        Her Majesty's Commissioner shall, as soon as possible after the execution of this treaty, cause to be taken an accurate census of all the Indians inhabiting the district above described, distributing them in families, and shall in every year ensuing the date hereof, at some period during the month of July in each year, be duly notified to the Indians and at or near their respective reserves, pay to each Indian family of five persons the sum of fifteen dollars Canadian currency, or in like proportion for a larger or smaller family, such payment to be made in such articles as the Indians shall require of blankets, clothing, prints (assorted colours), twine or traps, at the current cost price in Montreal, or otherwise, if Her Majesty shall deem the same desirable in the interests of Her Indian people, in cash. <br><br>
                        And the undersigned Chiefs do hereby bind and pledge themselves and their people strictly to observe this treaty and to maintain perpetual peace between themselves and Her Majesty's white subjects, and not to interfere with the property or in any way molest the persons of Her Majesty's white or other subjects. <br><br>
                        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Her Majesty's said Commissioner and the said Indian Chiefs have hereunto subscribed and set their hand and seal at Lower Fort Garry, this day and year herein first above named. <br><br>

        <!--Content for the outside promises section under the Post-Treaty - Aftermath-->
        <ul>
            <li>The written treaties did not contain any promises on the provision of farming tools, clothing, or animals, which were discussed during the negotiations. These broken promises are called "Outside Promises". Even though Chief Henry Prince and others refused to sign the treaty, Simpson agreed to put these promises in writing. By 1872, Indigenous people complained that they were cheated and the promises were not kept. Archibald blamed Simpson and the lack of a resident Indian commissioner. In 1873, Joseph Provencer was given the role. The government did not act until April 30, 1875, when they passed an order saying that those promises were now part of the treaty. These included provision of animals, tools, and raising the yearly payments to $5 from $3.</li><!--Source for this info--><sub><a href="sources.html">#5</a></sub><br>

                        Dans un mémoire de l'honorable ministre de l'Intérieur en date du 27 avril 1875 signalant la très grande insatisfaction des Indiens à l'égard des «promesses ultérieures» aux traités nos 1 et 2 conclus avec les Indiens du Manitoba et des Territoires du Nord-Ouest les 3 et 21 août 1871 respectivement, et faisant les recommandations suivantes:<br>
                        On a memorandum dated 27th April, 1875, from the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, bringing under consideration the very unsatisfactory state of affairs arising out of the so-called "outside promises" in connection with the Indian Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, Manitoba and North-west Territories, concluded, the former on the 3rd August, 1871, and the latter on 21st of the same month, and recommending for the reasons stated:<br>
                        1st. That the written memorandum attached to Treaty No. 1 be considered as part of that Treaty and of Treaty No. 2, and that the Indian Commissioner be instructed to carry out the promises therein contained, in so far as they have not yet been carried out, and that the Commissioner be advised to inform the Indians that he has been authorized so to do.<br>
                        2nd. That the Indian Commissioner be instructed to inform the Indians, parties to Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, that, while the Government cannot admit their claim to anything which is not set forth in the treaty, and in the memorandum attached thereto, which treaty is binding alike upon the Government and upon the Indians, yet, as there seems to have been some misunderstanding between the Indian Commissioner and the Indians in the matter of Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, the Government, out of good feeling to the Indians and as a matter of benevolence, is willing to raise the annual payment to each Indian under Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, from $3 to $5 per annum, and make payment over and above such sum of $5, of $20 each and every year to each Chief, and a suit of clothing every three years to each Chief and each Headman, allowing two Headmen to each band, on the express understanding, however, that each Chief or other Indian who shall receive such increased annuity or annual payment shall be held to abandon all claim whatever against the Government in connection with the so-called "outside promises," other than those contained in the memorandum attached to the treaty.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>The treaties did not include promises on hunting and fishing rights, though there were verbally promised. Later, the government restricted access to these resources, breaking the promises. The Supreme Court of Canada has said the written text of the treaties doesn't fully show the true context, and the historical meaning should be considered. Indigenous peoples likely didn't understand the term "surrender" the same way the Europeans did, and their views on land and law were conflicting. These problems led to the constant debate on it to this day.</li><br>
            <li>Terms such as cede(cession - giving up control of land), adhesion (the Indigenous joining a treaty they weren't initially in), land title (Indigenous rights to their land due to their long use and occupancy) and annuity(yearly payments given to them per the treaties) were used commonly in the treaties.</li><!--Source for this info--><sub><a href="sources.html">#6</a></sub><br>

        <li>Naawi-Oodena - The construction of the largest urban reserve made, showing that the treaty still holds strong and therefore it is still used to create more reserves in the area. This particular reserve is focused on engaging in active economic actions. </li><br>
        <li>"Urban reserves, whether in accordance with a Treaty Land Entitlement agreement or not, can only be created through Canada's Additions to Reserve Policy. This policy identifies circumstances under which land may be granted reserve status and sets out steps to be followed by the Government of Canada in assessing a First Nation's proposal for reserve lands. Proposals to set land apart as reserve must include a number of requirements, including the resolution of municipal concerns, before the process can proceed further."</li><br>
        <li>The statement above means that in order to make a reserve, you need to follow a "treaty agreement" (treaty one and other corresponding treaties.) to amke it officail and recognised for indigenous people, put does not restict economic endeavors.</li><!--Source for this info--><sub><a href="sources.html">#7</a></sub><br>
