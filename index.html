        <h4><b><u>Welcome to Treaty 1 - Simplified (Grade 4 - 8)</u></b></h4>
        <p>Treaty 1 was signed on August 3 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, was the first of the Numbered Treaties and fostered the creation of Mantioba as a whole. It was agreed upon by the Canadian Government and the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree peoples of southern Manitoba who both had different goals as a whole. The Canadian Government wanted land for expansion and to settle colonists, while the Indignous were pursuing their survival and protection of their culture for their descendants.<sub><a href="sources.html">#1</a></sub>
            <p>We will be discussing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where and Why the Treaty was signed?</li>
                <li>What was agreed upon?</li>
                <li>How it affects us today?</li>
            </ul>
