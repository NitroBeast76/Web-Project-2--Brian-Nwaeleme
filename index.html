        <h4>Welcome to our website on Treaty 1</h4>
        <p>We will be discussing the first of the Numbered Treaties - Treaty 1, which was the foundation for the formation of Manitoba as we know it today. Signed at Lower Fort Garry in 3 August, 1871 between Canada and the Anishinabek and the Swampy Cree of southern Manitoba. With both parties interests different, the Europeans foucesd on getting land and expanding influence, while the indigenous more on how to survive and protect their culture and descendants.
            <p>We will be discussing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where and Why the Treaty was signed?</li>
                <li>What was agreed upon?</li>
                <li>How it affects us today?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The map of the treaties are below, including a description of the Treaty One</p>
